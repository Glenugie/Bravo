The prototpye requires a local mysql server to run properly
I've included a mysql file that can be imported to set up the databases, however it still requires the server to be running
I know XAMPP comes packaged with MySQL, but a standalone server should work just as well
Requires login details "root" and no password ""

Apologies for any inconsistencies in the SQL file, I reconstructed the database from memory, so it could be problematic
This is just a temporary solution until the database guys get a storage solution ready
